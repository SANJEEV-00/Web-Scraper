This project involves scraping Hacker News to extract article rankings, titles, and links using Node.js with libraries like `axios`, `cheerio`, and `csv-write-stream`. The scraped data is saved into a CSV file for further analysis. The results are displayed on a simple, attractive webpage styled with modern CSS. The page includes a responsive table with hover effects for easy navigation and a clean, user-friendly layout.
